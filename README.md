Assignment for CS2 demonstrating a comprehension of backtracking

This program was created during the course of my CS2 course during the
spring of 2016. While the checking and drawing methods were developed in
class with the assistance of the professor, the methods involving backtracking
were of my own.

The purpose of this program was to show a comprehension of concepts related to
backtracking.

The code is complete and has been fullly commented.
